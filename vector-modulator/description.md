Design a Vector Modulator with the above recommended block diagram. 

Each block is designed and simulated in Keysight ADS. It must be able to fulfill these parameters:

• 16 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation)

• Fc =5.4 GHz

• 900 Msps, min
(mega symbols per second)
double side-band
(assume 1.8 GHz min BW)

• 8.5 dB max insertion loss

• +/- 3.5º phase accuracy vs.
frequency

• 1.4:1 VSWR, max,
50 ohms input/output

• +/- 0.70 dB amplitude variation vs.
frequency

• Insertion Loss = Noise Figure
(NO Amplifiers)

• Design for:
– min DC power
– min cost
– min size– max RF power handling– maximum switching speed• Use Rogers 4003, 20 mils thick
